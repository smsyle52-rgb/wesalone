// these predicates, and `queries/contact-filter/ctwa-retarget` already takes a
// type from `repositories/contact-inbox` — so hosting them there would close an
// import cycle (`madge` flags it even though that one is type-only).

// Every table reference below is dereferenced INSIDE a function, never at
// module scope. `queries/index.ts` re-exports this file, so importing any
// query pulls it in — and a suite that mocks `@chatbotx.io/database/schema`
// narrowly (only the tables it needs) would crash on import if the column were
// read eagerly. Same reasoning as `conflictTargetFactoryByChannel` in the
// ads-conversion-event repository.
