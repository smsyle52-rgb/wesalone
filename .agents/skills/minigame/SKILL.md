  Work on the Minigame tool — the Jackpot slot-machine game (and four
  scaffolded-but-unimplemented types: luckyWheel, gashapon, drawLots,
  scratchOff) that workspaces create, share a public play link for, and
  track plays/prizes for. Use when touching minigame CRUD, the type picker,
  prize/draw logic, the public play page or play token, the jackpot preview
  UI, or extending gameplay to a new minigame type. Read this BEFORE editing
  anything under `features/minigames`, `business/src/minigame`, or
  `minigame-play-token` to avoid the silent "only jackpot works" traps.

No worker/queue code exists for minigames — grep confirms zero hits in `apps/worker`/`packages/worker-config`. Everything runs synchronously in builder server actions/pages; outcome messages are dispatched via the pre-existing `chatQueue`/`integrationQueue` from inside `recordPlayAndDispatch`, not a dedicated queue.

## Data flow in one line

`create/edit minigame (builder) → {{minigame_play_token}} resolved into a shared link at message-send time → public /minigames?minigameId&token page → verify token → resolvePlayState → JackpotPlayScreen → playMinigameAction → recordPlayAndDispatch (draw prize, decrement stock, send outcome message)`.

## The traps (read before editing)

1. **"Only Jackpot is playable" is enforced in FOUR separate un-linked places, with no compiler-enforced fan-out.** Unlike the `ChannelType` cascade (repo invariant #3, a `Record<ChannelType,...>` breaks the build if you miss a case), `MinigameType` has no such guard:
   - `MINIGAME_TYPES_ENABLED_FOR_CREATION = ["jackpot"]` in `constants.ts` — gates the type picker only.
   - `play-minigame.action.ts` — `if (minigame.type !== minigameTypes.enum.jackpot) throw ...`.
   - `apps/builder/src/app/minigames/page.tsx` — `if (minigame.type !== "jackpot") return <MinigameNotice comingSoon>`.
   - `MinigamePreview` — `if (type === "jackpot") return <JackpotPreview>` else generic placeholder.
   Extending gameplay to a second type means updating **all four**, and forgetting one compiles fine and fails silently (wrong UI shown, or a 403 that looks like a bug). If you add a type, search for every `=== "jackpot"` / `!== "jackpot"` / `minigameTypes.enum.jackpot` literal first — do not assume the list above is exhaustive by the time you read this.

2. **Concurrency-critical code lives in `minigame-contact-service.ts` — read `reliability-concurrency` skill before touching it.** `drawPrize`, `resolvePlayState`, and `MinigameService.update`'s prize-quantity reconciliation all depend on `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` locks taken **inside** the caller's transaction, plus `insert().onConflictDoNothing()` for the first-play race on `MinigameContact_minigameId_contactId_key`. Do not replace these with an application-level check-then-write — that's exactly the race these patterns close. `recordPlayAndDispatch` deliberately sends the outcome message **outside** the transaction (fire-and-forget, `.catch(() => {})`) so a failed message send never rolls back an already-recorded play — don't move message dispatch inside the transaction "to be safe."

3. **No probability redistribution when a prize sells out.** `drawPrize` filters out prizes with `quantity <= 0` before drawing, but does not rescale the remaining `winRate`s — the excluded prize's share silently becomes extra lose-rate. This is intentional and tested (`resolve-minigame-prize.test.ts`'s sold-out case) — don't "fix" it by redistributing without checking that test first.

4. **`MinigamePrizeSettings` must sum to exactly 100%.** `isMinigameProbabilityTotalValid` (in the partials file) does integer-cents rounding (`Math.round(total*100) === 10_000`) specifically to avoid float drift; both the Zod `.refine()` and the builder's prize-list editor call this one helper — don't reimplement the sum check separately.

5. **`MinigamePlay.prizeName` is a denormalized snapshot, not a live join.** `prizeId` is a plain `text` column, not an FK — prizes live in `Minigame.prizeSettings` jsonb and can be edited/deleted after the fact. History intentionally shows what the prize was *at play time*; don't add a join to "fix" stale-looking names.

6. **`minigameService.update`'s quantity reconciliation only protects the same prize `id` across the load-then-save window** (compares submitted quantity against a client-captured `originalPrizeQuantities` baseline; if unchanged since load, the current — possibly play-decremented — DB value wins). Deleting a prize row in the form and adding a new one (new `createId()`) has no cross-id reconciliation — the old prize's decremented stock is simply dropped.

7. **`newFriendTagIds` (general settings) and `MinigameContact.referrerContactId` are schema-complete but unimplemented** — no code populates a referrer or applies these tags. The builder form hides the corresponding field with a comment; don't re-expose it without wiring the referral flow first. Same for `shareEnabled`/`shareMessage` (share UI is commented out in the form).

8. **`{{minigame_play_token}}` is minted at message/broadcast-send time, not at click time**, with a 24h TTL (`DEFAULT_TOKEN_TTL_MS` in `minigame-play-token.ts`). An old saved/forwarded link fails `verifyMinigamePlayToken` and renders the same generic "forbidden" notice as an unauthorized request — there's no distinct "link expired" UX today.

9. **`minigameService.findUnscoped(id)` is the only workspace-unscoped lookup on the service** — it exists because `/minigames` is a public route (registered in `proxy.ts`'s `publicRoutes`, bypassing auth entirely). Every call site (`app/minigames/page.tsx`, `play-minigame.action.ts`) re-checks `payload.workspaceId === minigame.workspaceId` from the verified token immediately after calling it. Any new public entry point must use the plain `actionClient` (not `workspaceActionClient`, which assumes a session) and must repeat both the token verification and this workspace-match check — there is no shared middleware doing it for you.

## Adding gameplay for a new minigame type (recipe)

1. Add the type's UI (preview, form fields, play screen) — mirror the jackpot components under `components/preview/` and `components/play/`.
2. Flip `MINIGAME_TYPES_ENABLED_FOR_CREATION` in `constants.ts` to include it.
3. Update the type gate in `play-minigame.action.ts` and `app/minigames/page.tsx` (trap #1 — grep for every `"jackpot"` literal, don't trust this list to be complete).
4. Extend `MinigamePreview`'s dispatch to route to the new type's preview.
5. If the new type needs its own appearance/settings shape, extend the discriminated unions in `packages/database/src/partials/minigame.ts` rather than overloading the jackpot-shaped fields.
6. Add/extend tests mirroring `resolve-minigame-prize.test.ts` if draw logic changes.

## i18n

Namespace `minigames.*` in `apps/builder/messages/en.json`. This repo's invariant applies in full: update all locale files under `apps/builder/messages/` (19 translated locales + `en.json`), not just English — see the `minigames.*` keys added across all of them in the feature's introducing commit as the reference pattern.

## Verify

```bash
pnpm --filter @chatbotx.io/business vitest run __tests__/minigame-service-update.test.ts __tests__/resolve-minigame-prize.test.ts
pnpm --filter @chatbotx.io/encryption vitest run __tests__/minigame-play-token.test.ts
pnpm --filter builder check-types
pnpm lint
```

No automated test covers the public play page/action or the builder CRUD UI — verify those manually: create a jackpot minigame, open the public `/minigames?minigameId=...&token=...` link, play until draws run out, and confirm the history table in the builder reflects the plays.
