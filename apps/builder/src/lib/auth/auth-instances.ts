 * thunk runs once, with no request/tenant context, and the resulting provider
 * captures `clientId`/`clientSecret` in a closure for the process lifetime. So a
 * single auth instance can only ever sign in with one app per provider. To let
 * each reseller use *their own* OAuth app (their brand on the consent screen),
 * we build a separate auth instance per distinct credential and cache it.
 *
 * The set of distinct apps is small and bounded (the platform defaults plus the
 * resellers who registered their own), so the cache stays tiny. Every instance
 * shares the same secret, cookies, adapter and session config, so a session
 * minted by one instance is read back by the default `auth` instance used
 * elsewhere (middleware, proxy).
