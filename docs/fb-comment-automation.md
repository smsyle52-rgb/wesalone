# Facebook & Instagram Comment Automation

This document describes the **comment automation** feature: how a comment on a Facebook
Page post or an Instagram post flows from the webhook to an automated reply, how each
config option is matched and enforced, and the non-obvious pitfalls that have caused
silent failures. It is the reference for anyone touching the comment-automation code.

> Scope: the three `CommentAutomationChannelType` values (`channel-type.ts`) —
> `messenger` (Facebook Pages), `instagram` (Instagram Login) and `instagramFacebook`
> (Instagram via Facebook Login). All three share one table, one worker loop and one set
> of filters; the per-channel capability differences are listed under
> [Known gaps](#known-gaps--pitfalls).

## Tables

| Table | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `fbCommentAutomationModel` | [`packages/database/src/schema/fb-comment-automation.ts`](../packages/database/src/schema/fb-comment-automation.ts) | One automation config per row: post targeting, keyword filters, public/private reply, hide rules, schedule, options. |
| `fbCommentAutomationReplyModel` | [`packages/database/src/schema/fb-comment-automation-reply.ts`](../packages/database/src/schema/fb-comment-automation-reply.ts) | Dedup ledger: one row per `(automationId, contactId, postId)` written after every successful reply. Unique index `FBCommentAutomationReply_dedup_idx`. |
| `fbCommentAutomationEventModel` | [`packages/database/src/schema/fb-comment-automation-event.ts`](../packages/database/src/schema/fb-comment-automation-event.ts) | Analytics log: one row per `(automationId, commentId, replyChannel)` — the comment text, the text the bot sent, and `sent`/`failed`. Backs the per-automation **View Analytics** page. 30-day retention via the `purgeCommentAutomationEvents` cron. |

Zod partials (option/reply/post/schedule shapes):

## End-to-end flow

```
Facebook Page / Instagram post (comment added)
  → webhook: messenger (field === "feed", verb === "add")
             instagram, instagram-facebook (field === "comments")
  → BullMQ "incomingComment" job
  → apps/worker/.../received-message.ts  receiveComment()      (save message, gate on active-hours)
  → BullMQ "processCommentAutomation" job (jobId = comment-auto-${commentId})
  → apps/worker/.../comment-automation/index.ts  processCommentAutomation()
       loop over active automations → filters → dispatch public + private reply
  → (AIAgent reply only) BullMQ "commentAIReply" job (delayed)
  → apps/worker/.../comment-automation/ai-reply.ts  processCommentAIReply()
```

## Facebook ID formats (critical)

Facebook `feed` webhooks send composite ids. Getting these wrong is the #1 source of
silent failures:

| Field | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `post_id` | `{pageId}_{storyId}` | `2094067177305463_2357494887629356` |
| `comment_id` | `{storyId}_{commentId}` — anchored to the story **even for a reply** | `2357494887629356_1544045903933592` |
| `parent_id` | **Always present.** For a **top-level** comment it points at the post, but **not always as the same string as `post_id`** (see below); only a **reply to another comment** carries that comment's id. | top-level on a reel → `2094067177305463_2357494887629356` |

**`parent_id` on a top-level comment varies by post type.** Production payloads from one
Page (2026-09-11):

| Post type | `post_id` | `parent_id` |
|---|---|---|
| Reel / video | `698869923319232_122151505431003083` | `698869923319232_122151505431003083` — identical |
| Photo | `698869923319232_122101949313003083` | `39455509950714790_122101949313003083` — leading half is the **album**, not the Page |

Only the trailing story id agrees in both. A photo post therefore breaks any
`parentId !== postId` test, which reads every top-level comment as a reply and — with
`ignoreCommentReplies` on by default — swallows the whole automation.

- `parent_id` presence does **not** mean "this is a reply." Use
  `isCommentReply(parentId, postId, commentId)` (`index.ts`), which compares the
  **trailing** ids via `normalizePostId` — never the raw strings.
- A reply is safe to tell apart because `comment_id` stays anchored to the story: a reply
  to `{storyId}_{parentCommentId}` is itself `{storyId}_{replyId}`, so the trailing half
  of `parent_id` (the parent comment) is never the leading half of `comment_id` (the
  story).
- The post picker stores different formats per tab: **published/ads** store the composite
  `{pageId}_{postId}`; **reels** store a bare video id; **manual entry** is whatever the
  user pastes. `matchPost` normalizes both sides on the trailing story id
  (`normalizePostId`) so all three match the webhook `post_id`.
- **Instagram ids are not composite.** Its `comments` webhook carries a bare comment `id`
  and a bare `media.id` (used as `postId`), and the `ig-comments` picker stores those same
  bare media ids — `normalizePostId` is a no-op there.

## Config options — matching & enforcement

All matching happens in the automation loop in
[`comment-automation/index.ts`](../apps/worker/src/integration/handlers/comment-automation/index.ts).
Each filter that fails calls `logAutomationSkipped(..., reason)` (logged at `info`) and
`continue`s to the next automation — so a skipped comment always leaves a log line.

| Option / field | Meaning | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| `isActive` | Automation on/off | `findActiveAutomations` filters `isActive: true`. |
| `type` | `messenger` \| `instagram` \| `instagramFacebook` | `findActiveAutomations` filters `type === channelType`, which is the incoming `integrationType`. The builder writes it: `fb-comments` → `messenger`, `ig-comments` → the selected Instagram variant. |
| `startTime`/`endTime` | Daily active window (workspace tz) | `isWithinSchedule` — lexicographic `"HH:mm"` compare, handles overnight windows; null → always within. |
| `post` (`all` / `postIds`) | Which posts | `matchPost` — `all` always true; `postIds` matches via normalized trailing id. |
| `options.ignoreCommentReplies` (default **true**) | Skip replies-to-comments | Skips only when `isCommentReply(parentId, postId, commentId)` is true. |
| `includeKeywords` (`all`/`equal`/`contain`) | Text must match | `matchKeywords` — lowercased both sides. `equal` = whole comment equals a keyword; `contain` = substring. |
| `excludeKeywords` | Text must not contain | `matchKeywords` — substring, lowercased. |
| `options.replyToNewContactsOnly` | Only first-time contacts | `getPriorContactInboxCount(contactId) > 1` → skip. Counts `ContactInbox` rows. |
| `options.replyOncePerUserPerPost` | Once per user per post | `findDedup(automationId, contactId, postId)` exists → skip. |
| `options.replyToUsersWhoCommentedOnOtherPosts` (default **true**) | If off, only engage each user on their first post | When `false`, `hasRepliedOnOtherPost` (a dedup row with a different `postId`) → skip. |
| `options.likeUserComment` | Auto-like the comment | Runs only if the incoming comment's DB message was found (`findBySourceId`). |
| `hideComments.*` | Auto-hide matching comments | `applyHideComments` — `all`, `hasPhoneNumber` (PHONE_RE), `hasLink` (LINK_RE, matches bare domains too), `hasKeywords` (case-insensitive), `hasImage`/`hasVideo`. |
| `hideComments.showCommentsAfter` | Auto-unhide delay | Enqueues a delayed unhide job (`jobId = unhide-comment-${commentId}`). |
| `publicReply` / `privateReply` | The reply | See [Reply types](#reply-types). |
| `replyAfter` | Delay before replying | `computeDelayMs` → passed as BullMQ `{ delay }`. |

**All filters must pass** for a reply. After a successful dispatch, `insertDedup` writes a
`(automationId, contactId, postId)` row (used by both `replyOncePerUserPerPost` and
`replyToUsersWhoCommentedOnOtherPosts`) and `incrementRepliesCount` bumps the counter when
`willSendReply` is true.

## Reply types

`publicReply` and `privateReply` each have a `type` and a `value`:

| Type | `value` | Public reply behavior | Private reply behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `none` | — | no-op | no-op |
| `text` | the text | Posts a public comment reply: message `type: "comment"` + `contentAttributes.replyToCommentId`, enqueued as `sendChannelMessage`. | `PRIVATE_REPLY_TEXT_SENDERS[channelType]` (`private-reply.ts`) → the channel's comment_id-anchored Send API DM. |
| `flow` | flow id | Enqueues `sendFlow` with `flowId` and a `public` `commentAnchor`, so **every** message step of the run is posted as a comment reply — the anchor is not one-shot (`POST /{comment-id}/replies` can be called repeatedly). Runs on the **comment-anchored** conversation. | Same job with a `private` anchor: the flow's **first** message is sent through the comment_id-anchored Send API (comment window, not the 24-hour messaging window); later messages take the normal window-gated path, because Meta allows only one anchored DM per comment. Runs on the **DM** conversation — see below. |

### Which conversation a flow reply runs on

Delivery and state are two different things, and a comment splits them:

- **`commentAnchor` governs delivery.** It rides the `sendFlow` job and decides how each
  outgoing message goes out. `replyChannel: "private"` is one-shot — the first
  message-producing step claims it for the comment_id-anchored Send API, and the anchor
  then keeps travelling marked `spent: true` (`executeMultipleStepsGenerator`, `flow.ts`).
  Every message after that one — later in the same step, or in a later step — is a plain
  DM, which Meta only accepts inside the 24-hour window the contact's own message opens.
  A comment does not open one, so each channel's `sendFlowStep` calls
  `assertCommentPrivateReplyFollowUpDeliverable` (`@chatbotx.io/sdk`) against
  `contact.lastIncomingMessageAt` first: inside the window it sends normally, outside it
  throws `comment_private_reply_already_used`, which `sendFlowStep`'s catch records as the
  message's `sendError` so the inbox says why the rest of the flow never arrived. Before
  this the Send API simply rejected the follow-up and the error was swallowed.
  `replyChannel: "public"` is *not* consumed: it survives every step, node and re-enqueued
  `sendFlow` job of the run, so the whole flow answers on the post.
- **`conversationId` governs state.** The flow writes `currentStep` and
  `additionalAttributes.challenge` onto that conversation, and `resolveIncomingTextRouting`
  reads the challenge back off whichever conversation the contact's next message lands on.

A comment anchors its conversation to the post (`Conversation.sourceId = postId`,
`receiveComment`), while DM replies always land on the DM conversation
(`sourceId IS NULL`). So:

| Reply channel | Conversation | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `private` | the **DM** conversation, resolved by `resolveDirectMessageConversationId` (`findDMByContact`, falling back to `findOrCreate({ sourceId: null })`) | The contact answers in the DM. Running the flow on the comment conversation parks its state where no reply can reach it — the flow stalls at its first waiting step with no error anywhere ([#1063](https://github.com/ChatbotXIO/ChatbotX/issues/1063)). |
| `public` | the **comment-anchored** conversation (`ctx.conversationId`, unchanged) | The contact answers with another comment, which `receiveComment` resolves back to that same conversation. Switching this one to the DM conversation would break it. |
| `AIAgent` | **AI agent id** | Enqueues a delayed `commentAIReply` job → `processCommentAIReply` generates text with the **selected** agent (`generateAIReplyText`, tools/rich off) and posts it as a **public comment reply**. | Same job, `replyChannel: "private"` → generated text sent as a **DM**. |

The `AIAgent` path deliberately does **not** reuse the DM auto-responder pipeline
(`processAutomatedResponse`), because that pipeline always uses the workspace *default*
agent and always sends a DM. `generateAIReplyText` generates text only (no tools, no
send), and the comment handler owns the channel routing.

## Analytics

Each automation has a **View Analytics** row action opening
`space/{ws}/{fb,ig}-comments/{id}/analytics` — an area chart of replies per day, replies
by date, grouped customer comments, grouped bot replies, and an automation-scoped Error
Logs table. It is built on the shared reflink-analytics stack: service and repository in
`packages/analytics`, oRPC routes plus the zustand store and charts in
`packages/analytics-nextjs`, and a thin route shell in the builder.

Two things to know before touching it:

- **The data starts at deploy.** `FBCommentAutomationEvent` is the only source, and
  nothing backfills it. `FBCommentAutomationReply` cannot substitute — it holds at most one
  row per contact per post and carries no text, and `Message` has no `automationId` and no
  row at all for a private DM.
- **`repliesCount` and the event count differ by design.** `repliesCount` increments once
  per comment even when both a public reply and a private DM went out; the event log has a
  row per channel. Do not "reconcile" them.

## Known gaps & pitfalls

- **`parent_id` = `post_id` for top-level comments.** Never treat a truthy `parentId` as
  "reply." (Fixed via `isCommentReply`; regression here silently drops every top-level
  comment when `ignoreCommentReplies` is on.)
- **Post-id formats differ by picker tab.** Always compare via `normalizePostId`. Reels
  may still need verification that the stored `video_id` equals the webhook `story_id`.
- **Capabilities differ per channel.** Private DM replies work on all three channels
  (`PRIVATE_REPLY_TEXT_SENDERS`), but comment liking exists only on `messenger` and
  `instagramFacebook` — Instagram Login has no like API, so its `likeComment` handler
  is a logged no-op — and the attachment lookup behind `hideComments.hasImage` /
  `hasVideo` is implemented only for `messenger` (`comment-attachment.ts`
  short-circuits every other channel to "no attachment"). The `ig-comments` form gates
  each toggle separately: the like switch renders only for `instagramFacebook`, while
  `hasImage`/`hasVideo` are hidden for both Instagram variants. Keep that pattern —
  hide an unsupported toggle rather than rendering a dead one.
- **An AI reply records its analytics event in two places.** The dispatcher opens the row
  with `replyText: null` (the text does not exist yet); `processCommentAIReply` settles it
  with the generated text, or marks it `failed` with the bail-out reason. Every
  `rollbackCommentDedup` in `ai-reply.ts` is paired with a settle through
  `abandonAIReply` — miss one and a silent non-reply shows on the analytics page as a
  success, which is exactly what the Error Logs panel exists to prevent.
- **A private flow reply must be enqueued on the DM conversation.** Reusing the
  comment-anchored `conversationId` strands the flow: the first message is delivered, the
  flow parks on the post conversation, and the contact's reply arrives on the DM
  conversation where no challenge exists. Nothing throws, no queue errors, no `sendError` —
  the routing simply falls through to `automatedResponse`. See
  [Which conversation a flow reply runs on](#which-conversation-a-flow-reply-runs-on).
- **Instagram comment replies are text-only.** `POST /{ig-comment-id}/replies` accepts
  nothing but `message`; there is no `attachment_url` (that is a Facebook Page comment
  feature, used by `integrations/messenger`). A media step in a *public* reply flow
  therefore cannot be delivered on either Instagram variant: `sendComment` throws
  `ChannelError(PAYLOAD_INVALID)` so the failure lands on the message row as a `sendError`
  the inbox shows. It used to `return { messageIds: [] }` with only a `logger.warn`, which
  made the step vanish while the inbox still displayed it. On Messenger the same step does
  post, carrying `attachments[0].url` as `attachment_url` — only the first attachment. To
  deliver media in answer to a comment, use a **private** reply: the comment_id-anchored Send
  API takes attachments and templates. (Corroborated by
  [openreply](https://github.com/diwenne/openreply), an Instagram-Login project whose
  `sendCommentReply` likewise posts only `{ message }`, and which routes everything richer
  through a `recipient: { comment_id }` button template.)
- **Everything in a public reply flow is public — including sub-flows.** The `public` anchor
  is never consumed, so every message step of the run posts under the post, and that includes
  steps reached through `startAnotherNode` / `startExternalFlow`. Do not point a public reply
  at a flow written for a 1-to-1 DM: discount codes, personal details and personalised links
  become publicly visible. Use `privateReply` for those.
- **A public reply flow still loses its anchor across a Wait step.** `ContactOnSmartDelay`
  has no column for `commentAnchor` and `buildSendFlowResumeJob` rebuilds the job from that
  row alone, so steps after a wait fall back to a DM send. Documented at `step.ts`'s
  `handleWait`; fixing it needs a schema change.
- **`options.trackUserTags` is defined but not implemented** — the toggle has no effect.
- **`getPriorContactInboxCount` counts `ContactInbox` rows**, so a contact who DM'd via
  another inbox is treated as "not new."
- **Silent skips must log.** Every `continue` in the loop calls `logAutomationSkipped`. If
  you add a new filter, add a skip log too — otherwise production debugging is blind
  (`processCommentAutomation` returns `void`, so BullMQ always records `returnValue: null`
  regardless of what happened).
- **Instagram-via-Facebook private replies go through the Page node, never the IG node.**
  `sendPrivateReplyMessage`
  ([`integrations/instagram-facebook/src/apis/comment.ts`](../integrations/instagram-facebook/src/apis/comment.ts))
  must post to `/{pageId}/messages`. Meta exposes the `messages` edge only on the Page for
  this login type; `/{igId}/messages` is rejected with `(#3) Application does not have the
  capability to make this API call.` even when the app holds `instagram_manage_messages`,
  `pages_messaging` and Human Agent at **Advanced Access** — code 3 means "this edge does
  not exist here", not "permission missing", so chasing it in the App dashboard is a dead
  end. This has regressed twice ([#875](https://github.com/ChatbotXIO/ChatbotX/pull/875)
  moved it to `pageId`; [#945](https://github.com/ChatbotXIO/ChatbotX/pull/945) moved it
  back to satisfy a stale test whose fixture had no `pageId`, so the endpoint silently
  became `/undefined/messages`). The blast radius is every private reply on that channel —
  automation `text`, `AIAgent`, the first message of a `flow` reply, **and** the agent's
  manual private reply from the inbox, which enters through
  `handlers/comment/outgoing-private-reply` instead of the automation loop. The Instagram
  Login variant is different on purpose: it posts to `me/messages` on
  `graph.instagram.com`. `send-private-reply.test.ts` now pins the node and asserts the IG
  node is never called — do not "simplify" that away.
- **The two Instagram packages log under the same module name.** Both
  `integrations/instagram/src/lib/logger.ts` and
  `integrations/instagram-facebook/src/lib/logger.ts` call
  `getChildLogger("integration-instagram")`, so `module=integration-instagram` in
  production does **not** tell you which login type failed. Use the request host
  (`graph.facebook.com` = via Facebook, `graph.instagram.com` = Instagram Login) or the
  stack trace path instead.

## Testing

[`apps/worker/__tests__/comment-automation.test.ts`](../apps/worker/__tests__/comment-automation.test.ts)
covers: `isCommentReply`, reply filtering, `matchPost` normalization, the
`replyToUsersWhoCommentedOnOtherPosts` gate, AIAgent enqueue (public/private), the
`processCommentAIReply` delivery paths, per-channel private-reply routing (messenger /
instagram / instagramFacebook) and flow-reply comment anchors, and hide-keyword
case-insensitivity. Run:

```bash
pnpm --filter worker vitest run __tests__/comment-automation.test.ts
```
