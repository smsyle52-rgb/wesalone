## Claude Code — additional guidance

### Preferred workflow

1. Read the relevant skill file in `.agents/skills/` before writing code for a new feature, API, database table, worker, or integration.
2. When touching `packages/database`, always run `pnpm --filter @chatbotx.io/database db:migrate` after schema changes.
3. After any code change, run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm --filter <app> check-types` before reporting done.
4. Use `pnpm fix` (Biome auto-fix) instead of manually formatting code.

### Skill → task mapping

| Task | Skill to read first |
|------|---------------------|
| New feature / page | `feature-scaffold` |
| New API endpoint | `orpc-api` |
| New DB table or migration | `drizzle-database` |
| New background job or queue | `worker-development` |
| New channel integration | `integration-channel` |
| Contact filter field/operator, filter SQL, or contact-based audience | `contact-filter` |
| Facebook/Messenger comment automation (auto-reply/like/hide on Page post comments) | `fb-comment-automation` |
| New flow step with states (success/error/skip routing) | `flow-step-development` |
| Dev/build/lint commands | `turborepo-workflow` |
| Approved implementation plan | `implement-plan` |
| Security-sensitive change (auth, scoping, webhooks, AI tools, permissions) | `security-review` |
| Writing tests / verifying a change is done | `testing-workflow` |
| Concurrent code (worker jobs, migrations, replace-writes) | `reliability-concurrency` |

### Specialist agents (`.claude/agents/`)

Dispatch these project subagents by name when relevant:

| Agent | When |
|-------|------|
| `invariant-guard` | after editing `apps/`/`packages/`/`integrations/` — checks the ChatbotX invariants no linter enforces |
| `rag-eval` | changes under `packages/ai` or the embedding repositories/handlers |
| `incident-responder` | triaging a production error or failed job |

Reviewers, planners, build-fixers, etc. come from the `~/.claude/` global set — don't recreate them here.

### Model routing (cost)

Default to the cheapest tier that fits the task; reserve the top tier for judgment:

| Task class | Tier |
|------------|------|
| file lookup, grep, inventory, verification/refutation | Haiku / Sonnet |
| implementation, code review, debugging | Sonnet |
| architecture, synthesis, incident root-cause | Opus |

### Never do without checking

- Do not use `git add -A` or `git add .` — stage specific files only.
- Do not commit `.env` files or secrets.
- Do not skip `pnpm lint` — the CI will fail.
- Do not hardcode user-facing strings — use `useTranslations()`.
- Do not import `db` directly in `apps/` or `integrations/` — all DB access must go through a service (`@chatbotx.io/business`) or repository (`@chatbotx.io/database/repositories`). See `.agents/rules/data-access.md`.
- Do not use dynamic `import()` in tsdown-built code (`packages/*`, `integrations/*`, `apps/worker`, `apps/cli`, `apps/mcp-server`) — it breaks the tsdown build. In `apps/builder/src` dynamic imports and `next/dynamic` are allowed (and preferred for heavy client islands). See `.agents/rules/no-dynamic-import.md`.
